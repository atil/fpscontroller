# First Person Controller for Unity

This Q3-inspired first person controller is made with two goals in mind:

- Arcade feeling facilitates strafejumping / bunnyhopping, allowing easy-to-play-hard-to-master movement. It uses similar movement logic used in quake / halflife games to achieve oldschool feel.

- Avoid using CharacterController and make every step of the logic as transparent as possible.
