# First Person Controller for Unity

This Q3-inspired first person controller is made with two goals in mind:

- Arcade feeling facilitates strafejumping / bunnyhopping, allowing easy-to-play-hard-to-master movement. It uses similar movement logic used in quake / halflife games to achieve oldschool feel.

- Avoid using CharacterController and make every step of the logic as transparent as possible.

## Quick start:

- Unpack [the package](FpsController.unitypackage)

- Add a layer "PlayerCollider" and set the player's collider to be on that layer

- Add that layer to `FpsController.ExcludedLayers` on the prefab. Collision and grounded checks will ignore these layers
